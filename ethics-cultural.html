            <h2>Ethical Dilemma Response</h2>
            <p>
                The project was also under some time pressure, and some members of the team were suggesting that it was
                possible to skip final reviews of code to save time in the project. Being a team leader, I had to make
                decisions based on whether to deliver quality or meet deadlines.

            <p>
                I will be a person of integrity and operate on a very high level of honesty, and make ethical decisions.
                When reporting to the clients or the results, I will not lie at all, even under the external pressure or
                the internal challenges in the project.

            <h2>Cultural Adaptation Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                The integration process of me into the American engineering work environment has been a change and an
                eye-opener. As an Indian, I went through a moderate cultural shock as the American approach was somewhat
                different, coming to a country where the professional environment is more democratic and where deference
                to authority is inculcated in everyday life.
